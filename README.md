# weather.bom.gov.au
[An archival mirror](https://bomweather.firebaseapp.com) of the now defunct "weather.bom.gov.au" website. The website was retired in March 2023 in favour of the mobile application serving the same.

Some minor changes have been made to allow the website to function as of May 2023, and the original website can be found in the `weather.bom.gov.au.zip` file.

Changes:
* Rain Radar has been removed due to a defunct API call
* 3-hourly forecast has been changed to an hourly forecast
* Feels-like temperature is not showing in hourly forecast
* Feedback and etc. have been removed from Footer.
